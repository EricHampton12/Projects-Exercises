### MVP

By default, the app should **_do something_**

#### Wireframe

![wireframe](wireframe.png)

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Process

##### Setup:

1. Create repo, for example: `my-app`
2. Locally, navigate to your `sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name` into your Sites folder
4. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
5. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
6. Save all and create your first commit to `master`

###### Application File Structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        /style.css - stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        /main.js
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

##### Develop:

4. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
1. Add content and elements to your website
1. View changes and test locally
1. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
1. Push your commits to GitHub remote

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Post links to your GitHub repo to the Projects and Exercises Slack channel
