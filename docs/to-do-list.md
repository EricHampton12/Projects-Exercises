# To-Do List

### Description

Create an online to-do app

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

By default, the app should display items on to do list

The to-do list should meet the following functionality requirements:

- display all to-do list items
- prompting text to add item
- ability to remove item
- cross out or check off item as "completed"
- remove all completed items
- ability to see number of remaining items
- ability to check off or cross out all items in one click as a "completed all" function
- ability to press a button and all items become active again
- three "views" for the user:
  - all to-do list items
  - only completed items
  - only active non-completed items

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Objectives

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

###### Setup:

1. Create repo, for example: `to-do-list`
2. Locally, navigate to your `sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name` into your Sites folder
4. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
5. Create necessary files for application
6. Import necessary css/js files (Bootstrap)

<!-- ###### Optional Setup for eslint

1. in your repo top directory,
2. `npm init`
3. `eslint --init`
4. add the following line to your `.gitignore`
   1. `node_modules/` -->

###### Develop:

1. Add content and elements to your website
2. View changes and test locally
3. Save often, and commit to github when important changes happen

###### Deploy:

1. Push your code to Github remotev

### Application file structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page (only one page for this exercise)
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        /style.css - stylesheet
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        /main.js
    img/ - folder to contain any images
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above, and you must only have one index.html

### Requirements

Website must be responsive

### Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

### If you finish early...

1. Improve error messaging to be more specific to the terminal.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
3. Add links and resources from this week to the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources) by forking the repo and then initiating a pull request with your additions to the .md file.
