# Countdown Exercise

### Description

Create a webpage that displays a countdown, in digital clock format

For this project we will be using the Date object and setInterval

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

By default, the app should display a countdown timer.

#### Wireframe

See [wireframe-js-countdown.png](https://github.com/bootcamp-s19/exercise2-js-countdown/blob/master/docs/wireframe-js-countdown.png)

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Objectives

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

###### Setup:

1. Fork repo `exercise2-js-countdown`
2. Locally, navigate to your `Sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name-git` into your Sites folder
4. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
5. Create necessary files for application
6. Import necessary css/js files (Bootstrap)

###### Develop:

1. Add content and elements to your website
2. View changes locally with MAMP (localhost)
3. Save often, and commit to github when important changes happen

###### Deploy:

1. Push your code to Github remote
2. Post links to your Github repo to the [exercises Slack channel](https://bootcamp-s19.slack.com/messages/CGD9QUH6E/)

### Application file structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        /style.css - stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/  - folder to contain JavaScript files
        /main.js
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

### Requirements

Style it as you wish.

Display the time as it counts down and make sure it updates every second.

Website must be responsive.

### Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

### If you finish early...

1. Change the font for the display; a monospace font would look more like a digital clock, and it wouldn't jar your eyes as the variable-width string is recentered every second.
2. Accept user input for length of timer.
3. Stop the timer when countdown reaches 0.
4. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)

### Too Easy?

1. play an audible alert when countdown reaches 0.
2. PLAY THE SONG.
3. Make it look like an analog countdown timer!
