# Project 1: Campaign Website

### Description

Create a website promoting your favorite _FICTIONAL_ character from a book, TV show, movie, or graphic novel, who is running for the elected position of Constable in your magistrate district of Fayette County. (There are 3 such districts.)

Briefly research the role of Constable, then design a political website for your chosen character. [Here's a link to get you started,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constables_in_the_United_States#Kentucky) [ and here is another link with useful info that you will need.](#)

### Website Content

Your website should introduce the public to your candidate, explain why they are running, and list three issues that are important to them.
Your job is to make it easy for voters to see whether your candidate's beliefs align with their own.
To keep things light and fun, pick issues that pertain to the character in their fictional setting, not the real world. :-)

### Objectives

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

###### Setup:

1. Create Heroku account
2. Setup and Run MAMP server locally
3. Fork existing repo: [https://github.com/bootcamp-s19/project1-campaign-website](https://github.com/bootcamp-s19/project1-campaign-website)
4. Clone the forked repo locally in your `~/Sites/__your__project__1__folder__ folder`
5. Add a index.html to `/campaign-website`
6. Add a style.css file to the `/css` sub-directory
7. Edit the index.html file to include the Bootstrap reference via CDN
8. Edit the index.html file under the bootstrap CDP to include your css file

###### Develop:

1. Add content and elements to your website
2. View changes locally with MAMP (localhost)
3. Save often, and commit to github when important changes happen

###### Deploy:

1. Create Heroku App with existing repo `heroku git\:remote -a yourproject1`
2. Push your code to Github remote
3. Push your code to Heroku remote
4. View your website on your laptop and phone
5. Post links to your Github repo and Heroku application to the [projects Slack channel](https://bootcamp-s19.slack.com/messages/CGAUZ4SA0/).

### Application file structure

Minimally:

```
yourappname/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain css files
       /style.css - your unique stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
composer.json - file for composer
composer.lock - lock file for composer
Procfile - **no** file extension
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

### Requirements

1. Website must be responsive
2. Website must contain at least [3 distinct organisms](https://patternlab.io/) that you create using the following:
   1. Choose at least Four Bootstrap Components to include from this list:
      - Badge
      - Button
      - Caption
      - Card
      - Collapse
      - Icon
      - List Group
      - Media Object
      - Popovers
      - Tooltip
   2. Augment Five Bootstrap Utilities to suit the needs of your website
3. A few (more than 3) prominent pictures of your candidate
4. A table displaying important information for voters
5. A call to action - election day is November 5!
6. Scroll to an anchor tag
7. Punch out to a website

### Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

### Remember to deploy to Heroku!

You will need to follow our example boilerplate to set up a MAMP server.

You will also need to include a Procfile so Heroku knows how to start your server.

### If you finish early...

1. Continue to add content and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Implement bootstrap components from this list that will enhance your site
   - Carousel
   - Jumbotron
   - Nav/Navbar
   - Progress
   - Spinner
   - Jumbotron
3. Augment more Bootstrap Utilities to enhance your website
4. Download Bootstrap and compile via Sass instead of using CDN
5. Add info to your projects README.md (don't use the supplied .md file for your project, these are just instructions for you) [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
