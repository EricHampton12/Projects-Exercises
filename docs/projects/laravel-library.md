### MVP

By default, the app should let a Librarian maintain a simmulated library via a web interface that is connected to the Google Books API

#### Wireframe

[Library Wireframes](../wireframes/library) - you do not need to copy these exactly, its just an idea

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. React.JS
5. MySQL
6. PHP
7. Laravel

### Process

##### Setup:

1. Create repo, for example: `my-app`
2. Locally, navigate to your `sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name` into your Sites folder
4. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
5. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
6. Save all and create your first commit to `master`

###### Application File Structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        /style.css - stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        /main.js
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

##### Develop:

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Post links to your GitHub repo to the Projects and Exercises Slack channel

### Requirements

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Use the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started) to generate book content for users to check in and out from the library
2. Store library card holders in your local MySQL database with the following database schema:

Users

- userid (string)
- user name (string)
- number of books currently checked out (integer)

Books

- bookid (string)
- userid of user that currently has this book checked out (foreign key)
- times the book has been checked out (integer)

3. Full CRUD operations should be avaliable for `Users`
4. Read access should be avaliable for `Books` (it is not possible to perform Create, Update, or Delete functions on the Google Books API) via GET requests
5. Only save the books in the book table AFTER a user decides to check the book out. (no need to save all the books locally, that's what the API is for)
6. Use React.js for creating components to put on Laravel Blades.
7. Users do not need to be real people, this can be simmulated by you by clicking a "new user" button in the admin interface as a Librarian. (think 'library simmulator')
8. Show all user and book statistics that are saved in database (for example: There are 3 users registered with the library, user "bob" has 2 books checked out: "Algorithms", and "Design Patterns", user "phil" has 0 books checked out, and user "sally" has 1 book checked out: "The Pragmatic Programmer") you can format this data however you'd like, we suggest a table with multiple tabs
9. Be able to click any user or book and view the info as well as perform full CRUD where applicable.

#### Additional Requirements

- Website must be responsive
- Style your app as you wish
- Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources).
- Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
  - _**Remember to push to GitHub!**_
  - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

#### Stretch Goals

- Create a search bar for querying books from the Google Books API
- Implement Laravel Auth using composer to create many "Librarians"

#### If you finish early...

1. Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
3. Add links and resources from this week to the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources) by forking the repo and then initiating a pull request with your additions to the .md file.
