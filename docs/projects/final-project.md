### MVP

By default, your app should use all the technologies learned throughout the bootcamp.

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. React.JS
5. PHP
6. MySQL
7. Laravel
8. Google Cloud

### Process

##### Setup:

1. [Create GitHub repo (either online or locally)](../git-instructions.md), for example: `my-app`
2. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
3. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
4. Save all and create your first commit to `master`, **then** switch to a dev branch

##### Develop:

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote
6. For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of `dev` onto a `new-feature` branch and create a PR into dev when complete

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master` on GitHub
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Push Final Portfolio to Google Cloud remote
4. Post links to your GitHub repo and the Google Cloud Link to the Projects Slack channel

### Requirements

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Create a MVP document with all documentation strategies defined by Agile Software Development

- Create user personas, user stories, MoSCoW, etc.
- Design wireframes
- Design database architecture
- Add MVP to your projects README.md

2. Create a Full Stack Web App using all the technologies learned throughout the bootcamp
3. Have full CRUD functionality
4. Use React.js for components and front end functionality
5. Use Laravel for blades and back end connectivity
6. Use Google Cloud and Firebase for site and database hosting
7. Link Google Cloud live link to your github repo in README.md and the [project description](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7757751/how-do-you-change-a-repository-description-on-github)

#### Additional Requirements

- Website must be responsive
- Style your app as you wish
- Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources).
- Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
  - _**Remember to push to GitHub!**_
  - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

#### Stretch Goals

- Hit an API
- Use NPM for new packages
- Learn a new framework for front end development
- Learn a new framework for back end development
- Continue to maintain your app after the bootcamp ends

#### If you finish early...

1. Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
3. Add links and resources from this week to the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources) by forking the repo and then initiating a pull request with your additions to the .md file.
