# Tic Tac Toe Exercise

### Description

Recreate the childhood classic, tic-tac-toe, in JavaScript.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe for more information.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

By default, the app should do the following:

1. Use the symbols X and O.
2. On each players turn, that player places one of their symbols on an
   unoccupied space by clicking.
3. The game continues until one player places three symbols in a
   straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and wins or there are no
   remaining available spaces and it is a draw.

#### Wireframe

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Objectives

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

###### Setup:

1. Create repo, for example: `tic-tac-toe`
2. Locally, navigate to your `sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name-git` into your Sites folder
4. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
5. Create necessary files for application
6. Import necessary css/js files (Bootstrap)

###### Develop:

1. Add content and elements to your website
2. View changes locally
3. Save often, and commit to github when important changes happen

###### Deploy:

1. Push your code to Github remote
2. Post links to your Github repo to the [exercises Slack channel](https://bootcamp-s19.slack.com/messages/CGD9QUH6E/)

### Application file structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        /style.css - stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/  - folder to contain JavaScript files
        /main.js
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

### Requirements

Style it as you wish.

Include a Restart Game button.

Website must be responsive.

### Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

### If you finish early...

1. Allow players to enter their names.
2. Keep track of number of games won by X and O.
3. Add a link to rules, display in a modal.
4. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)

### Too simple? Try...

1. Recreating Checkers.
2. Recreating Othello.
3. Recreating Go.
4. Recreating Chess.
5. Create an AI to beat whoever plays, every time.
